Welcome to Sam Gleske's openbox configuration for the eeePC 900.  I installed
openbox on easypeasy 1.5 and this config directory is an exact copy of my
configurations so that you may know how my setup is configured.  Please note
that in the configuration files locations such as /home/sam/ may not exist on
your installation because that is the username I chose.  Whenever you see ~/
I mean /home/sam/ directory for me or whatever your username is for you.

icons directory was located ~/Pictures/.  This houses many of my wbar icons.

openbox directory was located ~/.config/.  This contains my openbox resource
files.  Files like menu.xml was configured using the obmenu application.
rc.xml contains my custom defined keyboard shortcuts such as (super key is the
same as the Windows key on a win keyboard or the home key on eeePC):
Super+d shows the desktop
Super+w opens web browser
Super+t opens terminal
Super+l locks the screen using xlock (part of the xlockmore package)
Super+o turns of the screen.  This is good for when I'm remote controlling
other computer keyboards and mice using synergy (http://synergy.sf.net/).

scripts directory was located ~/.config/.  This contains my custom scripts for
maintenance tasks or openbox menu customizations.

tint2 directory was located ~/.config/.  This contains my taskbar configuration.

The files within the wbar directory was located /usr/share/wbar/.  This
contains the custom Mac OS X like menu.  For some of the icons google chrom and
the pidgin instant messaging client must be installed.

The bash_aliases file was located and renamed to ~/.bash_aliases.  This has my
custom aliases which I think new users to Linux will find useful.  If you don't
know what bash aliases are then google "Linux aliases" and there should be some
good articles which explain the topic.

The vimrc file was located and renamed to ~/.vimrc.  This has some of my
custom settings for vim which I use regularly.
